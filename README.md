# Coding Challenge Submission

In this repo you'll find my solution to the coding challenge.

## Algorithm Challenge
You can find a `README` inside the `algorithm` directory for an explanation of the reasoning I used to work throught the problem. Additionally you'll find instructions on running the application.

## App Challenge
My app submission is contained in the `BluetoothDiscoverer` directory. There exists a signed apk in `app/release/app-release.apk` that can be used to install the application on an android device.
